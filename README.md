# ðŸ“Š Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project analyzes a marketing campaign dataset from a bank to understand what factors influence whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. It combines exploratory data analysis (EDA) with machine learning models to uncover actionable insights.

## Project Structure

- `bank.csv`: The dataset used in this project. [Bank Marketing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/janiobachmann/bank-marketing-dataset)
- `bank_marketing_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, visualizations, and model training.
- `visuals/`: (Optional) Saved figures from the notebook for easier reference or presentations.

## Objective

To identify key client and campaign features that influence the likelihood of term deposit subscription, and to build a model that can predict it accurately.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Converted categorical columns  
   - Flagged outliers and engineered new features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed distributions and deposit success rates by job, age, education, and more  
   - Uncovered behavioral patterns tied to contact method, timing, and frequency

3. **Modeling**  
   - Compared Logistic Regression and Random Forest  

## Key Insights

- Clients with higher balances and no housing/personal loans were more likely to subscribe  
- Fewer contacts led to higher success rates â€” over-contacting reduced effectiveness  
- Campaigns in March, October, and December saw better results compared to May  

## Tools Used

- Python
-   * Pandas
    * Seaborn
    * Matplotlib
    * Scikit-learn
